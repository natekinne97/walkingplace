Are you looking for a new place to walk?
Search your location and you'll get a list of great parks to walk in.
Not only will you get parks but also sunscreen reccomendations and the current 
weather for that location. Remember just a 30 minute walk a day can help lower
blood pressure and help reduce stress.
